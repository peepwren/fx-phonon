Firefox 57+ ("Quantum") userChrome configuration for use with tree style tabs.

### Description
This theme presupposes that you're using the [tree style tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) extension. it hides the tab bar and combines the navigation bar with the window controls (— □ ☓) for a more compact browser chrome. Furthermore it lowers contrast of navigation bar buttons and add-on badges. Feel free to use it.

Dark theme variation.

### Notes
- Probably won't well with the default theme. Switch to the light or dark themes in the "Customize" menu.
- Written in a windows 10 environment. window controls and margins might get messed up on other operating systems.
- Simplified back/forward buttons. If they're the wrong color, go into about:config and set "svg.context-properties.content.enabled" to "true".  More info [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-context-properties)
- Should work with all densities for those of you into thick toolbars.
- The code is commented but unstructured. Sorry if it's hard to read.
